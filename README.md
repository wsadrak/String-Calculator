# stringocalculator
A simple console application made in Java that simulates a calculator for for operations of adding. The program communicates with the user and retrieves data in String format from him and calculate the result.

I made this program for learning unit tests and TDD.

## Examples

null => 0 <br/>
"" => 0 <br/>
"0" => 0 <br/>
"1" => 1 <br/>
"1+2" => 3 <br/>
"2+4-1" => 5 <br/>
"-10+3+1-2" => -8 <br/>
